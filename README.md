# Description

pyMovieShelf is a Python/Django based DVD and Blu-ray collection manager. It allows a user to search for and select a movie from IMDb's database. When selected, info from IMDb will be imported into the database. The user is presented with a full movie list, as well as a details page for each movie. Details shown for each movie include title, year, genres, length, a plot summary, format (DVD/Blu-ray/HD-DVD/digital), and a movie poster.

# Usage

pyMovieShelf is intended to be an app added to an existing Django install. Django can be installed as described on the following two pages:

* http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/intro/install/
* http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/intro/tutorial01/

# Requirements

Besides Django, pyMovieShelf requires IMDbPY (http://imdbpy.sourceforge.net/).
